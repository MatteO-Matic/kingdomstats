In order to provide an exciting spectacle for the audience, the combat area is often broken into distinct scenes to simulate various parts of the Roman Empire's expansion. Combatants put their lives on the line each time they step inside the arena, fighting both for personal glory and to satisfy the bloodlust of the spectators. <br/><br/>Black Forest（Command Mode - Conquest）<br/><br/><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3954/33236159530_1f26005e7a_b.jpg"/><br/><br/>Germania was a region to the north of the Roman Empire. At that time Germany was vast and wild, and apart from some sporadic Germanic tribes, most of the region was covered by rolling forests. The dense vegetation and tall conifers blotted out the sky and covered the sun, creating a humid climate and a lingering mist – perfect for an ambush! <br/><br/>Telamon（Command Mode – Conquest）<br/><br/><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2816/33236158770_a3197bbc3a_b.jpg"/><br/><br/>Situated on the Apennine Peninsula, Telamon is a city originally founded by the Etruscans and later conquered by the Romans. During the Republic, this is where the Romans pushed back invading tribes from the north and finally defeated them. This campaign was decisive in conquering Cisalpine Gaul, further expanding Roman control northwards.</ul><br/><div class="bb_h1"><b>Events</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embrace Spring<br/>Players logging into the game from Mar 28th to Apr 28th will receive a Spring Gift Pack (which includes a 3-Day VIP card, 1000 prestige and 30000 copper).<br/>Time-limited tasks from Apr 1st to Apr 2nd.<br/>Fight in 8 Command Mode battles each day to win 1000 prestige.<br/>Participate in 3 Duel Mode battles daily to win 500 exploit.<br/>Join 3 PVE battles every day to win 10000 copper and a Supplies Pack.<br/><br/><li>150% Gains Event<br/>The timed 150% gains event opens at the following time (based on the server time):<br/>Mar 28th – Apr 4th 18：00-22：00 NA Server (PST)<br/>Mar 28th – Apr 4th 13：00-17：00 EU Server (GMT)<br/>Mar 28th – Apr 4th 19：00-23：00 Asia Server (GMT+08:00)<br/><br/><li>First Recharge Event<br/>Mar 28th – Apr 25th, players charging any amount of money or buying any DLC will get a Ghost Axe and a 3-DAY VIP card.

In Command Mode, players will be encouraged to win through teamwork and those who prefer defensive roles will receive more reasonable gains. <br/>2. In Epic War, players will be encouraged to complete the mission quickly through teamwork rather than taking a longer time to achieve personal high scores.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command Mode - Conquest: the battlefield will be divided into personal and team scores. The winners will receive both personal and team scores instead of the previous system, where only personal scores affect gains. Generally speaking, the overall gains of winners will be improved; exp and coppers will be more evenly distributed among team members. The defeated side will not be adjusted for the moment. However, both sides will see an increase in scores for rescues and occupying flags.<br/><li>Command Mode - Siege: extra scores for winning the battle quickly and killing the marshal; and successfully guarding the gate.<br/><li>PVE scores: the scores will be divided into personal score and team score, with the personal score being lowered. The team will get extra team score according to the time they take to break a gate. Less time means higher scores. The gains will be calculated according to both personal and team scores.<br/><li>PVE rate: personal score rate has been changed to team score rate judged by the time used to complete PVE.</ul><li>The properties of enemies in PVE adjust according to the number of people on the battlefield.<br/><li>The time needed to recruit soldiers at the conscription site has been reduced from 1 second to 0.4 second. The restoration time used to conscript a soldier is decreased from 20 seconds to 10 seconds.<br/><li>The time-limited battle field – Squad Deathmatch is temporarily closed and will reopen after it is optimized.
