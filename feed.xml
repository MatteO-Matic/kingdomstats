I have a few things I'm thinking about to fix and add to in future. &lt;ul class=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add analyctis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I feel like I must add somekind of analyctis before I give the site any form of publicity.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;li&gt;About page&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change website theme&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I'm currently working on a new theme using bootstrap, didn't really like the way it ended up right now.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a page for each item&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;This is a static website, so I need to either write a python script that generates all the pages or some javascript does all the work. The result should be the same but I guess it's my disk space vs page CPU load.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add the forum&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I have a been working with a disqus forum I'll integrate later when it's finished, apart from having a /forum place for &quot;general topics&quot; I'm planning that each item page that is generated should also include a comment section where you can drop a comment regarding that item.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;li&gt;Changelogs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I'll be saving all the patches that I datamine and make diff logs, would be nice to see what changes the weapons/armors get for each patch.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; And so on, that was a few things from off the top of my head. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently the data represent the values of the game patch 0.0.72, it should be fairly up-to-date by the time I'm writing this this post. Unfortunately my graphic card died recently, so a new update on the values might take a little bit longer then expected. &lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Fixed a proper domain name, so welcome to tkstats.info. Seems like both a good and logical name to me. One step forward with this project but many left to go! I have a few things I'm thinking about to fix and add to in future. Add analyctis I feel like I must add somekind of analyctis before I give the site any form of publicity. About page Change website theme I'm currently working on a new theme using bootstrap, didn't really like the way it ended up right now. Create a page for each item This is a static website, so I need to either write a python script that generates all the pages or some javascript does all the work. The result should be the same but I guess it's my disk space vs page CPU load. Add the forum I have a been working with a disqus forum I'll integrate later when it's finished, apart from having a /forum place for &quot;general topics&quot; I'm planning that each item page that is generated should also include a comment section where you can drop a comment regarding that item. Changelogs I'll be saving all the patches that I datamine and make diff logs, would be nice to see what changes the weapons/armors get for each patch.
