The Xianbei nationality originated from the Donghu, Xisu and Wuhuan people and were under the Xiongnu for a long time. After the East Han defeated the Northern Xiongnu, all Xianbei fled from the old domains of the Northern Xiongnu. Having absorbed part of the Xiongnu culture, the Xianbei rose up.

In the Spring and Autumn Between the Han and Jin Periods, it says: \"when the soldiers seized the city to break up the camp, the first to charge the city wall was a suicide squad\". In this battle, Qu Yi led eight hundred first climbers to destroy Gongsun Zan's cavalry as a prelude to his downfall, then later the \"First Climber Suicide Soldiers\" earned their name.
